# Project Scope Statement (Revised)

## 1. Project Purpose and Justification

The purpose of this project is to design and publish a multi-page personal website that demonstrates foundational web development skills using HTML and CSS. The website will serve as both a technical learning artifact and a professional portfolio piece hosted publicly on GitHub Pages.

Over the past week, I have refined my understanding of what is realistically achievable within the time constraints. This scope focuses on building a clean, functional, and well-documented website rather than attempting advanced features beyond the course requirements.

## 2. Project Description

The final deliverable will be a two-page website built using structured HTML and a single external CSS file to ensure consistent design.

The site will include:
- A homepage (`index.html`) introducing the site and its purpose
- An About page (`about.html`) providing additional background information
- A single shared stylesheet (`style.css`)
- A professional `README.md`
- A `docs/` folder containing required project documentation

Both pages will include navigation links to each other and follow a consistent layout and color palette.

## 3. Project Deliverables

### Website Files
- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `style.css`
- Functional navigation between pages
- Consistent typography and layout
- A simple but intentional color scheme

### Documentation (docs/ folder)
- `scope.md` (updated with peer feedback incorporated)
- `plan.md`
- `retrospective.md`

### Repository Requirements
- Public GitHub repository
- Professional `README.md`
- README includes:
  - Link to the live website
  - Link to the `docs/` folder
- Live site hosted at `your-username.github.io`

---

## 4. Project Boundaries (In Scope vs. Out of Scope)

### In Scope
- Two HTML pages
- One shared CSS file
- Clear navigation structure
- Clean formatting and spacing
- Public hosting via GitHub Pages
- Required documentation files

### Out of Scope
- JavaScript functionality
- Responsive design beyond basic layout
- Backend/database features
- User authentication
- E-commerce functionality
- Paid tools or hosting services

The focus will remain on clarity, structure, and documentation rather than advanced features.

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:

- The GitHub repository is public and accessible.
- The live website loads correctly without errors.
- Both pages link to each other using working navigation links.
- All pages use the same external stylesheet.
- The design appears consistent across both pages.
- All required documentation exists inside the `docs/` folder.
- The README includes working links to both the live site and the documentation.

---

## 6. Constraints

### Time
The project must be completed by the assigned deadline. Development will be divided into stages:
1. Structure and layout
2. Styling
3. Documentation
4. Final testing and revisions

### Budget
There are no financial costs associated with this project. All tools used are free.  
Budget impact: $0.

### Technical Constraints
The website will be built using only HTML and CSS. No frameworks or additional programming languages will be used.

---

## 7. Assumptions

- GitHub Pages will remain operational and free to use.
- No major changes to project requirements will be introduced.
- The project will remain limited to two primary pages.

---

## 8. Risks

Potential risks include:
- Publishing delays due to GitHub Pages configuration
- Broken links between pages
- Time management challenges

These risks will be mitigated by:
- Testing links after each change
- Publishing early and verifying deployment
- Completing documentation before the final deadline

---

## 9. Project Approval

By submitting this revised scope statement, I confirm that this document defines the official plan for Project 03. I understand that I will be evaluated based on adherence to this defined scope.
